# Simulation Summer School by PsyPag 

#### This repository is created from materials and presentations of the PsyPAG Simulation Summer School 2021.
* I have created this repository to organize the material collected while attending the PsyPAG workshops.
* This repository includes scripts provided by workshop presenters together with links to their original material. I have included supplemental material and links to other resources to assist in my personal understanding of the subject matter. I have documented sources of the supplemental material and videos I used to study the material and code contained in the scripts should anyone using this material want to pursue the subject matter in more depth.  
* Materials and resources for each workshop are included in the respective folders.
